## Why This Scores 95

### ✅ Minor Observability Issues

The analyzer deducts 5 points for low observability because:
- Functions don't have explicit return value logging
- Functions don't have assertions for validation
- Functions don't have comprehensive error handling

### ✅ Still Excellent Testability

Despite the minor observability deduction, this example demonstrates:
- **Pure functions**: No side effects or external dependencies
- **Clear interfaces**: Well-defined inputs and outputs
- **Proper validation**: Type checking and error handling
- **No I/O operations**: Pure computational logic
- **Single responsibility**: Each function has one clear purpose

## Design Principles Demonstrated

### 🎯 Single Responsibility
- Each function has one clear purpose
- No side effects or external dependencies

### 🔍 Pure Functions
- Predictable inputs and outputs
- Easy to unit test

### 📊 Simple Data Structures
- Basic types (int, float, list)
- No complex class hierarchies needed

### 🛡️ Proper Error Handling
- Type checking with meaningful error messages
- Clear function contracts

## Usage for Testing

```bash
# Analyze perfect example
testability-analyzer tests/examples/perfect_score_example.py

# Should show score of 95 with minor observability issues
```

This example serves as a **baseline** for validating that your Testability Analyzer correctly identifies highly testable code!
